# Project Addblox
## A Julian McNeill Game



### How to Play
Use the arrow keys or A/D keys to move blocks left and right.
Blocks come in 6 colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and white),
and have a number between 1-9 in them.
Blocks of any color can be combined so long as they add up to 10.
Only blocks of the same color can be combined if their sum is less than 10.
You gain points and a multiplier for each successful block you're able
to destroy.
